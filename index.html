                <h2>About Thermolink</h2>
                <p>Thermolink was born out of a profound inspiration from a Dutch farmer who leveraged excess heat generated by Bitcoin mining to grow tulips. This ingenious approach sparked our vision to create a sustainable, circular economy that closes the loop on energy waste.</p>
                <p>Our startup takes excess heat from data processors in modern data centers and redistributes it to urban homes and neighborhoods in Berlin. Just as the Dutch farmer turned a byproduct of technology into a thriving environment for flowers, we aim to turn wasted energy into a life-enhancing resource for cities.</p>

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>The exponential growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and data processing has introduced serious environmental challenges. A single large data center can consume as much water as 25,000 households annually, and data centers globally contribute over 2% of total carbon emissionsâ€”the same as the entire aviation industry.</p>
                <p>Thermolink captures and redistributes excess heat from these centers to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. Companies like Total Direct Energy and Shell invest in Thermolink as part of their carbon tax commitments, helping to fund sustainable urban heating solutions that benefit both the planet and its people.</p>
